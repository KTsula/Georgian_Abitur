# Simple-Expo-app-with-firebase-and-react_navigation

This simple application stores a big number of notes that a current graduate of a Georgian high school has accumulated thoughout their period of being an "Abiturient" (last year of high school when all Georgian students have to pass same type of exams to get into Georgian Univeristies)

The app has several sections each with different type of content. They include quotes, types of literature, interesting artistic observations. Basically everything that you will find there will help you prepare for your Georgian National Exam in Georgian Language & Literature.

Unfortunately you can not add you own notes to those at the moment, but you can submit a request for that and I will be happy to add that feature to it if anyone is interested.

The app is published on Google Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abitur.AbiturGeo

Expo was used to develop the app since its easy to use and allows for creation of an app for both apple and android users at the same time, while React Native CLI is slightly more difficult to set up and windows users can not develop IOS apps without looking for some type of workaround.

To run your own version of the app, clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/KTsula/Simple-Expo-app-with-firebase-and-react_navigation.git
```

install dependencies
```
yarn install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

To run the app, you'll need to have the Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install it by running the following command:
```
yarn install -g expo-cli
```
Once you have the Expo CLI installed, you can start the app by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
expo start
```
